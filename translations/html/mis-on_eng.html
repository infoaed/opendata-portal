<p><strong>What is the open data portal?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://opendata.riik.ee" rel="nofollow">The open data portal</a> is intended to serve as a platform where to gather the records of the public<em>datasets</em> created by public bodies and local authorities and where new datasets can be made public. On one hand, it is a place where the owners of the dataset or <em>holders of information</em> can register or upload their datasets. On the other hand, it is a place where the stakeholders and regular citizens can search and download the published data and use it for further processing or information requests.</p>
<p><strong>Goals of opening up data:</strong></p>
<p>Opening up data, their collection and making available on a single platforms serve several important purposes:</p>
<ul><li>to stimulate economy;</li>
<li>to increase transparency;</li>
<li>to decrease the number of information requests and, consequently, also reduce the workload of public sector workers;</li>
<li>to facilitate creation and management of open services for private and community sectors</li>
<li>to encourage migration to future technologies such as <a href="http://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkandmed" rel="nofollow">Linked Data</a>, "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things" rel="nofollow">Internet of Things</a>" ja "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data" rel="nofollow">Big Data</a>".</li>
</ul><p><strong>What are open data?</strong></p>
<p>Open data is taken to mean raw data that is freely made available online for use by everybody in a machine readable format without any restrictions on use and distribution. In general, if no charge is stipulated in legislation for the retrieval of data, the open data can be retrieved free of charge and without any restrictions on access. More information (in Estonian) on the principles, technologies and processes of opening up data is available <a href="http://opendata.riik.ee/juhendid/juhend-avaandmete-avaldamiseks-ning-avaandemete-portaali-kasutamiseks" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of data can be found here?</strong></p>
<p>All datasets which are created by government agencies and local authorities, whose public use is not directly forbidden and which contain other data than personal data are to be made public and registered on the open data portal. If the datasets contain both personal and non-personal data, only the non-personal parts of the data will be made public.</p>
<p>In particular, the data in the datasets to be published should in general be created, collected or administered by a government agency or local authority. A government agency or a local authority may, with the consent of a third party, also publish the data of that third party if it considers it to be of sufficient interest to the public.</p>
<p>Such datasets may be collections of agreements, regulations, correspondence metadata, budget files, statistics files, databases/registers converted into a publicly readable format or web services which retrieve information from such databases/registers. It is not reasonable to regard a single agreement, regulation, etc. as a separate dataset whereas a single database typically should be regarded as a separate dataset.</p>
<p>In technical sense, a published dataset may be either a collection of human-readable text files (such as a collection of statutes, regulations, agreements or official announcements) or a collection of machine-readable data (such as a database that is exported to CSV or XML files or a web service that allows searching and downloading all data in the dataset in, for example, json or xml format).</p>
<p><strong>How can open data be used?</strong></p>
<p>Published datasets can be used in many different ways and for different purposes, e.g., trend analyses in particular policy areas over certain periods of time, comparison of datasets of different government agencies and ministries in order to detect dependencies and derive potential new information, etc. Stakeholders who possess sufficient technical capabilities may, using published raw data, create useful and interesting applications and services for the public.</p>
