<p><strong>1. What is the government open data portal?</strong></p>

<p>The open data portal is intended to serve as a platform for the dissemination of data by public bodies and for searching and retrieving such datasets by open data users.</p>

<p>On the open data portal, it is possible:</p>

<ul>
<li>to search and download open data;</li>
<li>to publish new open data: to gain access to this functionality, a prior registration with the portal's administrator is required;</li>
<li>to use it as a storage of datasets by government agencies and local authorities;</li>
<li>to search and use applications created on the basis of open data;</li>
<li>to post news, questions and instructions pertaining to open data and to have discussions on relevant topics.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Why open up data?</strong></p>


<p>Opening up data and their collection, storage and dissemination serves the following important goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>to stimulate economy by the re-use of data;</li>
<li>to increase the transparency of the public sector;</li>
<li>to decrease the number of information requests and, consequently, also reduce the workload of public sector workers;</li>
<li>to facilitate creation and management of open services for private and community sectors;</li>
<li>to encourage migration to future technologies such as <a href="http://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkandmed">Linked Data</a>, "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things">Internet of Things</a>" and "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data">Big Data</a>".</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. What to publish?</strong></p>

<p>The publication of data created by public sector bodies serves many purposes, most importantly allowing private individuals, companies and third sector bodies simply to examine the existing data or to use it in their software applications to create value added. .</p>

<p>All datasets which are created by government agencies and local authorities, whose public use is not directly forbidden and which contain other data than personal data are to be made public. If the datasets contain both personal and non-personal data, only the non-personal parts of the data will be made public.</p>

<p>In particular, the data in the datasets to be published should in general be created, collected or administered by a government agency or local authority. A government agency or a local authority may, with the consent of a third party, also publish the data of that third party if it considers it to be of sufficient interest to the public.</p>

<p><strong>4.Which principles need to be followed when publishing datasets?</strong></p>

<p>Two goals must be balanced while publishing datasets:</p>

<ul>
<li>the data presentation should be convenient and understandable for the users;</li>
<li>the data publisher should be able to publish data with ease and minimal effort.</li>
</ul>

<p>Public sector data shall be considered open if it is made public in a way that complies with the principles below: (retrieved from: <a href="http://www.opengovdata.org/home/8principles" title="http://www.opengovdata.org/home/8principles">http://www.opengovdata.org/home/8principles</a> ):</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px">1. Complete<br />
All public data is made available. Public data is data that is not subject to valid privacy, security or privilege limitations.<br />2. Primary<br />Data is as collected at the source, with the highest possible level of granularity, not in aggregate or modified forms.<br />3. Timely<br />Data is made available as quickly as necessary to preserve the value of the data.<br />4. Accessible<br />Data is available to the widest range of users for the widest range of purposes.<br />5. Machine processable<br />Data is reasonably structured to allow automated processing.<br />6. Non-discriminatory<br />Data is available to anyone, with no requirement of registration.<br />7. Non-proprietary<br />Data is available in a format over which no entity has exclusive control.<br />8. Licence-free<br />Data is not subject to any copyright, patent, trademark or trade secret regulation. Reasonable privacy, security and privilege restrictions may be allowed.</p>

<p><strong>5. How can my organisation publish data on this portal?</strong></p>

<p>A Guidance for data publishers is found hereâ€¦</p>

<p><strong>6. Will personal information be at risk?</strong></p>

<p>The published data will not identify or provide ways to identify individuals, unless that information is already published (such as the names of the civil servants working at the ministries).</p>

<p><strong>7. What are the licence requirements for the published data?</strong></p>

<p>The open data must be published under a licence which permits its free and unlimited use, processing and distribution. Under the licence, it must be possible to distribute the data at the discretion of the user either without charge or for a fee.</p>

<p>We recommend that you pick a CreativeCommons licence, see <a href="http://creativecommons.org/" title="http://creativecommons.org/">http://creativecommons.org/</a>From among the licences listed on the site, we recommend the CC by 3.0 licence: <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" title="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</a></p>

<p><strong>8. Can the published data be used for commercial purposes (such as for the creation of paid services)?</strong></p>

<p>Reuse of data for commercial purposes is permitted. We will be more than delighted if profitable services are created using our data.</p>

<p><strong>9. What format and encoding types are recommended for datasets?</strong></p>

<p>As a principle, it is better to publish the data in an inconvenient format than to leave it unpublished at first and wait for a planned improvement in its encoding in the future. A published dataset can always be republished in a new and better encoding. We recommend that you publish your open data <strong>at least in a 3-star format</strong>.</p>

<p>The system of the Five Stars of Openness was developed in the UK by Tim Berners-Lee and we follow exactly the same scoring and goals: more stars means better format/encoding for the user. For examples and further information: <a href="http://lab.linkeddata.deri.ie/2010/star-scheme-by-example/" title="http://lab.linkeddata.deri.ie/2010/star-scheme-by-example/">http://lab.linkeddata.deri.ie/2010/star-scheme-by-example/</a></p>

<p><strong>10. How can people use opendata.riik.ee?</strong></p>

<p>TBA</p>

<p><strong>11. How can people submit applications created on the basis of open data?</strong></p>

<p>Go to the Apps page where you can find information on all applications which have so far been created on the basis of the open data. Once you have logged in to the portal, you can also submit your comments on the applications. Using a corresponding link on the Apps page, you can also submit your own application for publication on the portal. When approved by the administator, your application will be added to the portal.</p>

<p><strong>12. Is there a place where it is possible to discuss ideas, applications and using of the data?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, the portal's Forum serves that purpose. Furthermore, comments can be added to specific datasets and applications and we also have an open wishlist for new datasets.</p>

<p><strong>13. Where can I find further information on open data?</strong></p>

<p><strong>14. Will more public data become available in the future?</strong></p>

<p>Certainly! As the work on the project progresses, new open data will be added to the portal and the portal will also be linked to the open data portals of other countries.</p>
