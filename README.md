# opendata-portal: scripts, translations, hacks

This is the development repo for implementing multilingual UI support for [Estonian Open Data Portal](https://github.com/opendata-ee), a portal based on CKAN/Drupal integration of [Data.gov.uk portal](https://github.com/datagovuk/dgu-vagrant-puppet). If you are interested in why, take a look at [this issue from 2014](https://github.com/datagovuk/ckanext-dgu/issues/46).
